# CasePizzeria

The case - Pizzeria:
Create an application with the given functionality according to the following instructions.
The goal of the case is to gain insights in the way you work, how you solve problems and use patterns.
Write code that is easily maintainable, extensible, reusable and testable.
The application does not necessarily has to work functionally. It's more important to put clear code concepts.
Quality over quantity; pay attention to the work you do, rather than implementing all functionality.
Examples of the admin and client page are included.

Functionality:
Orders can be made on the client page. Orders will be stored.
The orders for a certain pizzeria are shown on the admin page.
The status of the order can be changed on the admin page. On the client page the accurate status is shown.
Clients can choose the way they want to be informed about status updates (like by e-mail, SMS, etc.). Status updates are communicated accordingly.
For pizzeria "Dominos" it's only possible to deliver pizzas, not to take away. For pizzeria "New York Pizza" it's opposite. This should be embedded in the order process.
It should be easy to switch the storage method, like text files or database.

Technical instructions:
The attached code structure (/src) can be used as a starting point, but you're free to choose otherwise.
Add at least one unit test.
Focus mainly on the business logic and less on, for example, configuring 3th party packages.
