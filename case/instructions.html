      <h5>The case - Pizzeria</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create an application with the given functionality according to the following instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of the case is to gain insights in the way you work, how you solve problems and use patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write code that is easily <strong>maintainable</strong>, <strong>extensible</strong>,
          <strong>reusable</strong> and <strong>testable</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The application does not necessarily has to work functionally. It's more important to put clear code concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quality over quantity; pay attention to the work you do, rather than implementing all functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Examples of the admin and client page are included.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Functionality</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Orders can be made on the client page. Orders will be stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          The orders for a certain pizzeria are shown on the admin page.
        </li>
        <li>
          The status of the order can be changed on the admin page. On the client page the accurate status is shown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients can choose the way they want to be informed about status updates (like by e-mail, SMS, etc.). Status
          updates are communicated accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          For pizzeria "Dominos" it's only possible to deliver pizzas, not to take away. For pizzeria "New York Pizza"
          it's opposite. This should be embedded in the order process.
        </li>
        <li>
          It should be easy to switch the storage method, like text files or database.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Technical instructions</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The attached code structure (/src) can be used as a starting point, but you're free to choose otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add at least one unit test.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus mainly on the business logic and less on, for example, configuring 3th party packages.
        </li>
      </ul>
